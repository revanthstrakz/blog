## Back Story

I am always fascinated with space and Astronomy. Since childhood i have been following all the articles and Information available on the Internet. My childhood passed away debating explaining Pluto is a dwarf planet to my teachers and friends who believes in Text Books rather than Internet and actual Facts *(The Situation arrived when i need to face a MCQ question : How many planets in our solar system ?  the answer according to Text Book is 9 but my answer is 8 according to Internet and Reality. Then the debate started one vs entire class who choose 9 planets and my General Science teacher supporting them. Though i lost that battle cause of majority, My education system I learnt a lesson that day which has a share in my present personality )*. Why are we even bothered about the Space in first place ? It all started in the period 1955 and 1975 between US and Russia.  The exploration turned into a Race and the outcomes and results of it ultimately changes the perspective about Space and Truths about Our Celestial Bodies.

## Now

Whats happening Now is a game of capitalists with brains. Who are trying to capture the opportunities dealt with space.
