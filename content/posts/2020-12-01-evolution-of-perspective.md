Time is getting shorter, things are going faster, Sorry we are making them faster . Our perspective about Time is changing. Prayer time decreased worship time decreased. " God allocated day and time to worship" became " Allocating Time for God". As if we are feeding The God. Don't know why festivals are present. Few occasional days like Father's Day mother's Day are created to mark that day and remind of that described day accordingly and memorize the related memories. But I don't understand why Devotional Festivals are present. Is God forgettable? According to me you have only two options! Either you believe in God or don't believe. But believers if you are believing in him then it's true that you are created by him and for sure uh are answerable for everything you are doing for him and against him. You cannot forget him at all at any moment. The instance where you prioritize someone or something over him, you already into sin. You can't deny the consequences.
