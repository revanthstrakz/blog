Instead of python commands use linux bash commans with exclamation mark appended with it ! eg: !ls for listing the file directories
```
!ls
```

# Suggestions

Write the script with the executable commands and upload it to the directory through the inbuilt file explorer located in the left pane or wget or curl -L from the Cloud and Execute it with 

```
!bash your-file.bash
#or 
!chmod a+x script.sh
!./script.sh
```
