# Is it Worth Wasting your precious Time.

Your ex may lose intrest in you or mistake may be anyones's but you need to forgive to forget. You may not forget completely as you dont have the ability of (ctrl+shift+del) but it helps in reducing the thoughts about your ex. First things first, never block them . Blocking a person might ncrease the chances of thinking about them more frequently. Stay away fron the places which remind you about your past relationship. Tell your friends about your decision and tell the to not remind of the past.
